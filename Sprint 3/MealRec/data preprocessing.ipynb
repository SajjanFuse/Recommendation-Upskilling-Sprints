Also use whole wheat flour for part of the white; I can\\\\\\'t tell the difference, so why not?  And 2 cups of sugar is more than enough... I\\\\\\'ve used a white and brown combo and even subbed a little honey for health and taste.  I\\\\\\'ve found 1 1/2 to 2 cups of \"extras\" is about right...1 cup nuts, plus 1/2 to 1 cup raisins, or dried cranberries or dried cherries or crushed pineapple; whatever.  It seems to work: nuts, no nuts, fruit, no fruit...whatever.  However, for sure, DON\"T drain the zucchini.  I also like a little more flavor from spices, so add a little fresh grated nutmeg (not too much; it\\\\\\'s potent.  Or 1 t. cardamom and/ or cumin along with the cinnamon.

I normally only review a recipe if I\\'ve followed it exactly.  This is not the case this time.  I had been asked to make a bread for a welcome basket at church to be given on Sunday, and I forgot until late Saturday night when it was too late to run to the store.  I ran out of AP flour & had to use about 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  I also ran out of sugar & ended up using over 1/2 light brown sugar.  I was totally out of regular vegetable oil & used part canola/part peanut.  Finally, I only had 2 eggs (instead of 3), but I decided to go for it since they were extra large eggs.  The bread still turned out fabulous.  I ended up just baking one loaf & using the extra batter for extra large muffins.  The muffins cooked in 40 minutes, and the bread took a touch over an hour.  Moral of the story: even if you have to make (a lot of) substitutions, this recipe will not disappoint.

I find the added zucchini doesn\\'t make the bread too moist and adds flavor and nutrition to the recipe. I also leave out the nuts (just my preference)\\\\nMy husband told me he actually prefers my healthy version and everyone has raved about this bread recipe either way. My thoughts--if you love zucchini bread as much as we do and want to eat it more often, try to come up with a healthier version for your family. It will not take away from the flavor whatsoever, and you may find you actually prefer it.\\\\nAlso DO NOT DRAIN THE ZUCCHINI!!

Anyway, the night before I tried this bread I stopped at my mother in laws house and she had just baked some a few days earlier so I tried it.  I was pretty bummed that zucchini bread was what I was going to make... much to my surprise... either something went wrong with her recipe, a few days old is too old, or this recipe just blows the other one out of the water!

We use it for more than just zucchini bread, too! We use it for banana nut & apple raisin. We also bake more than just bread with it!

Banana muffins generally bake for 20 minutes at the suggested 325 degrees, but I start checking them @ 15 minutes for that golden brown top. Apple Raisin takes closer to 30 minutes as muffins because the apples are so moist (like zucchini). I bake the banana nut breads for the same time and degrees as the zucchini recipe calls for, but the apple raisin bread cooks for the full 60 minutes, or until toothpick comes out clean :)\\\\n\\\\nWe always use half the oil, as many others have suggested/done, 1 cup white sugar and only 3/4 cup brown sugar (Instead of the recipes calling for 2 cups white sugar). When we turn this into banana nut bread, we use 5 bananas and as many crushed nuts as we desire. When we make apple raisin bread I have cut up 5 large Jonathon or early golden delicious apples sliced small, plus 1 cup raisins.

This is a good starter recipe if you are a good cook, but maybe you should keep looking if you never made zucchini bread before.  Too much oil.  I use 1 stick butter and half cup of applesauce.  more flavor less grease.  Of course this reduces moistness a little, so I use 1 cup of brown sugar.  More moisture and flavor.  TOO MUCH SUGAR, I reduce the overall sugar amount by 3/4 cup.  You\\\\\\'ll like it better less sweet.  Now, with more real flavors in the recipe, you can reduce some of the cinnamon.  3 teaspoons?  too much! but a bit of applepie spices gives it  fuller flavor though.  I bake it in muffin papers, now I have a perfect breakfast muffin.  (Baking about 25 min.)  And the guy who said, \"don\\\\\\'t drain the zucchini\"?  Pick the freshest one you can, grate it, stir it in the thin batter (before flour) and let it weap to get the additional moisture.  Then add flour and nuts.  I also top mine w/ cinnamon sugar and chopped nuts for that final touch (before baking.)  The problem with cooks?

I used dark brown sugar in place of white and added about a cup or so of raisins, omitted the nuts. DO NOT drain your shredded zucchini!!! This will take away from the moistness. Actually, I added more like 4 cups cus I had so much. I easily could have added 5. I baked it at 325 as stated. I do not own 2 loaf pans, so mine went in a 9x13 glass dish sprayed with a bit of Pam.

The top crust is very flavorful, so next time I might bake more of it in mini loaf pans, or in a brownie pan, to get more crusty surface area. Next time I will try adding more zucchini, because the pockets of flavor were wonderful but I felt it could use a lot more. I\\'m also going to add some nutmeg. I used bread flour in place of all-purpose, and canola oil in place of vegetable. I think it could probably stand a little more salt, but admittedly I do love my salt, perhaps a bit too much :) I\\'m also not a huge fan of nuts in bread, so I left out the walnuts, but that\\'s just personal preference. All in all, definitely a five star recipe. Next time I\\'ll have to make a huge batch and freeze some as the creator suggested, because oh my goodness is it wonderful!

I added 2/3 c. semi sweet chocolate chips, subbed natural apple sauce for the oil, subbed 1 cup of flour with King Arthur white wheat and used 2 over flowing cups of shredded zucchini.  With these changes, the recipe yielded 22 regular muffins and 12 mini muffins.  With my changes, each mini muffin is only 1.5 WW points, or 5 points for 3 minis (3 points for the regular muffins). I\\'ve made the original recipe several times, but adding the chocolate chips made this taste decadent without being unhealthy.  Lastly, I baked the muffins at 350 for 22 minutes (13 minutes for the minis). \\\\n\\\\nOld review: Excellent!

I had lot of zucchini to use up and couldn\\'t find my usual recipe. I was mainly looking for ingredient ratios. This recipe has potential, but to the experienced eye, there are several changes that immediately need to be made. That is way too much sugar and way too much salt. For a good traditional taste, try just 1 cup of BROWN sugar and 1/2 tsp. of salt. Use 3 cups of zucchini. Do not drain it, do not peel it, do not seed it. Cut off the ends and grate it. If you must use that much oil, use oil that tastes like something; melted butter and/or coconut oil. I like to use 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. applesauce. The batter will be ridiculously thick until you add the zucchini. Fold it in, wait 5 minutes, stir again. It will be thick but workable. Bake until it is done (until toothpick comes out clean). Due to differences in moisture levels in the zucchini you use, that may be the time stated, it may be way longer. Expect 60-90 minutes for a loaf.

My husband didn\\'t know which loaf was whose, and although he liked both, he (and I) liked the taste of my mother\\'s recipe best.

If you want to ensure that your bread is not soggy in the middle, you can drain the zucchini with a paper towel after it\\'s been grated.  Before pouring in the mix I put about a teaspoon of butter into the bread pans and stick it in the oven for like 3 minutes - it gets melted when you take it out and you can move the pan around to get the butter to evenly coat the bottom and sides so that the bread will come out more easily once it\\'s done.  Any extra butter from the pan I pour into the mix and stir it up a bit so it\\'s mixed in evenly.

I noticed some reviewers prefer less sugar, but I think the sugar is just right but I like it on the sweeter side. Also, it\\'s easier to mix the zucchini in with the wet ingredients first before mixing in the dry - the moisture makes the mixing much easier! This recipe makes 12 muffins and 1 loaf, but I prefer the loaf over the muffins because the loaf comes out much more moist and loose. Baking time in my regular oven is about 20-25 min for the muffins and 1 hr and 5 min for the loaf.
